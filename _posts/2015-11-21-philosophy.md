Our philosophy is simple, to add value to our clients projects through the production of high quality CGIs Photo-montages and Animations by engaging in client dialogue, our own experience, evolved workflows and hard work. 

We believe that the quality of our images and animations speak for themselves and that in each case, whether it be a marketing image for a high profile multi-million pound project or local planning consultation image for a smaller development, the individuality and ethos of each scheme is promoted by our images. This understanding of the images and projects that they portray can only come about by the continual dialogue that occurs between Architect / designer / client and artist. From the initial briefing to the final sign-off and throughout the lifecycle of the project you will be kept up to date with the progress of the image with interim submissions. This workflow invites you the designer to make comment and allows for adjustments in design whilst keeping us the artists informed as to your aspirations and expectations for the image.

Visual Eyes Media have had experience working with a range of international architectural practices and high profile developers including Foster and Partners, John McAslan and Partners, Land Securities, Derwent Valley, Crown Estates and NCP. These clients have utilised our skill sets to produce captivating animations, vibrant photorealistic still images and enlightening multimedia presentations. 

Visual Eyes Media is a new media company that has now been in operation for 10 years. In this time we have brought together a team of highly motivated and skilled individuals; each member having a minimum of a degree level in a 3D or graphics discipline ranging from architectural qualifications through to Interior and Graphic design, bringing to your projects a wealth of experience in presentation techniques, project management and client interaction. It is this experience that instills confidence in many of our clients that their schemes will be completed on time, on budget and to a standard of quality beyond expectation.
