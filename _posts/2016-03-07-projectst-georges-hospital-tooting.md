## Multiple images produced to show the proposed designs of a hospital fit-out.

Visual Eyes Media were commissioned to produce several images showing 'generic' spaces of St. George's Hospital, Tooting, London. The purpose of the images was not to show specific spaces but typical finishes and colour palettes as proposed by the interior design team. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ea152c9b7ac7da7c9b2c70772e620ea12504ea9e.jpg)
